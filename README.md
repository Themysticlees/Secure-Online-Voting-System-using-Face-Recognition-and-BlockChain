## Brief Description

An online voting system is an online voting technique. 
In this system, people who are registered in the system 
can cast his/her vote online without going to any 
physical polling station. There are many voting 
procedures that are being used for voting purposes, 
such as ballot paper, EVM machines but all these 
procedures require more time and more manpower. 
People also have to wait in long queues which takes 
a lot of time in the process.

To eliminate all these drawbacks, we provide an online 
system that provides features such as accuracy, 
convenience, and privacy. Our website will not only 
save time but also make a hassle-free user experience. 
Our online voting system provides a platform with 
proper instructions where users can register themselves 
and cast vote remotely. During the entire process, 
multiple verification processes are carried out which 
makes this entire system secure. This project gives 
freedom to the voter to use his/her voting rights 
from anywhere.

The main aim of this project is to cast votes with 
proper anti-corruption techniques and to minimize 
errors and be hassle-free.

## Objective of the Project
The specific objectives of the project include:

- Improving the existing/current voting process or approach.
- Implementing an automated voting system.
- Validating the system to ensure that only eligible voters are allowed to vote.
- An increasing number of voters as individuals will find it easier and more convenient to vote, especially those abroad.
